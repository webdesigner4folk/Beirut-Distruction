   <ins> What was the cause of the Beirut blast?</ins>  
        </h1>
        <p>
        The blasts were likely triggered by confiscated explosives, stored by authorities near the port. Major General Abbas Ibrahim, the head of Lebanon’s general security service, told state-run National News Agency, that “highly explosive materials” were stored in the buildings. These, he said, were seized by the government years ago.<br>

In fact, flashes of what appear to be fireworks could be seen in the footage, following the first blast.<br>
            

            <em>The National News Agency </em>also reported that the source of the explosion was believed to be a major fire at a warehouse in the area.<br>

Following the blasts, several locals also reported an orange cloud hanging over the city.<br>
            

            President Michel Aoun later said there was <mark>at least 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate</mark>, used in fertilisers and bombs, stored at the port without safety measures.
